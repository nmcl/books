To begin, click on the Dashboard tab in the console frame of this browser window. This will open the web console link in another tab or window of your browser.

You should see an OpenShift Origin window with Username and Password forms, similar to this one:

OpenShift Origin Web Console For this scenario, start by entering the following:

Username: developer

Password: developer

After logging in to the web console, you'll see a button labeled: New Project. Click this to get started.

You should now see a page for creating your first project in web console. Fill it in with the following:

New project

*Name

myproject

The rest is optional and up to you. Be careful with all of that responsibility.

After your project is created, you'll be taken to a screen where you can begin adding content to your project.
