The simplest way to deploy an application in OpenShift is to take an existing Docker-formatted image and run it. We are going to use the OpenShift web console to do this, so ensure you have the OpenShift web console open and that you are in the project called myproject.

The OpenShift web console provides various options to deploy an application to a project. For this lab we are going to use the Deploy Image method. As the project is empty at this point, the Overview page should display a prominent Add to Project button, otherwise you can also find an Add to project button in the top menu bar for the project.

Add to Project

After selecting Add to Project you should be presented with the options of Browse Catalog, Deploy Image and Import YAML/JSON. Choose the Deploy Image tab.

Add to Project Options

Within the Deploy Image tab, chose the Image Name option. This will be used to reference an existing Docker-formatted image hosted on the Docker Hub Registry. For the name of the image enter:

openshiftroadshow/parksmap-katacoda:1.0.0

and press enter, or click on the magnifying glass icon to the right of the text entry box.

Deploy Image

At this point OpenShift will pull down and display key information about the image and the pending deployment, as well as populate the Name field with parksmap-katacoda. This name will be what is used for your application and the various components created which relate to it. Leave this as the generated value as steps given in this and subsequent labs will use this name.

You are ready to deploy the existing Docker-formatted image. Hit the blue Create button at the bottom of the screen and in the subsequent page click the Continue to overview link. This should bring you back to the Overview page where summary information about the application you just deployed will be displayed.

These are all the steps you need to run to get a "vanilla" Docker-formatted image deployed on OpenShift. This should work with any Docker-formatted image that follows best practices, such as defining the port any service is exposed on, not needing to run specifically as the root user or other dedicated user, and which embeds a default command for running the application.
