# Enterprise Middleware: Principles and Practice
Code for the book with Santosh, Fabio and Stuart.

Not sure what the actual finished title will be but the aim is to cover 50 years of middleware principles, standards and implementations. Such things as consensus protocols (e.g., RAFT, Paxos), distributed interactions, transactions, use cases like OpenShift, Kubernetes, Netflix, etc.
