Code for book with Santosh, Fabio and Stuart.

Not sure about actual finished title but aim is to cover 50 years of middleware principles, standards and implementations. Such things as consensus protocols (e.g., RAFT, Paxos), distributed interactions, transactions, use cases like OpenShift, Kubernetes, Netflix, etc.
