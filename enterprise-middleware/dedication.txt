This book is dedicated to Elizabeth Little (born 6th May 1947, died 12th May 2020 from Covid-19). She was always
so supportive of me and my work, was instrumental in helping set me on the Computer Science journey when I was only
11 years old, and fought hard through her MS and cancer battles. I miss her.
